# flask-based-web-application-using-chat-gpt-api
This Flask based web application is integrated using chat gpt api.
As I am not a premium user of chatgpt i have limited access to use the api.
This web application is created to send the question to the application and get the output from chatgpt. We can see the output in our application.
I have used javascript, html and python to create this application.
You can get your secret api key from https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
I had to import flask and openai to make this application.
